# So You Want A Supercomputer...

## A Semi-Comprehesive Guide to Building a Research Computing Center From the Ground Up

### Ben Glick



This guide is designed to help people at small institutions build the capability to create a research computing center and associated infrastructure.

It's based on my experience of going through this process with Lewis & Clark College, from 2017 to 2020. It will describe scenarios that will likely be expereinced from the initial justification and budgeting phases all the way through sustained operation and support. It will also go into some of the "non-technical" aspects of building community and policy around your new HPC systems.
